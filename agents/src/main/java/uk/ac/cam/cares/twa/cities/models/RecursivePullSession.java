/**
 * {@link RecursivePullSession} operates in a loop where it calls {@link ModelContext#pullAll(Model)} on all items in
 * its working queue, causing invocations of {@link ModelContext#getModel(Class, String)} by {@link FieldInterface}s,
 * which are reported to {@link RecursivePullSession#queue(Model)}, where they are added to the pending queue. The
 * pending queue is then moved to the working queue and the process repeats.
 * <p>
 * Each round of pulling retrieves nodes one step away from the previous round's nodes, i.e. an additional degree of
 * separation from the origin provided in the session construction. Repeat visits are prevented by tracking the set of
 * traversed nodes. The number of rounds of pulling thus defines the maximum separation radius from the origin to
 * retrieve, which is our interpretation of {@code recursionRadius} for a non-acyclic graph. The breadth-first
 * strategy is necessary to prevent paths from cutting each other off.
