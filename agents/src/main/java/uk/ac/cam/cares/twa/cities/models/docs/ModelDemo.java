     * really need. Non-partial pulls and loads (they have the same underlying back end) are expensive proportional to
     * the number of triples/quads linked to the IRI(s) being pulled/loaded, regardless of whether they are defined in
     * the model. Partial pulls and loads, as used here, are by default slower, but scale with the number of fields
     * requested, and to a much lesser extent the number of fields in the Model. Partial pull with all Model fields
     * requested (no fieldNames requested will do this) has a valid use case if the latter time complexity is needed. */

     * This is why the three lines indicated above may be omitted: only one end of a triple which is doubly described

     * will not be observed as having been changed. However, if both were changed but not concordantly, then a conflict

     *   this.manager = newParent;
